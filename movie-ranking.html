<h3> Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Harry Potter is the most beautiful movie in the world for me.</p>
<h3>Merlin</h3>
<p>I’ve watched Merlin from start to finish exactly five times — it holds a special place in my heart.</p>
<h3>Medcezir</h3>
<p>Medcezir is my number one among all Turkish TV series — nothing compares to it for me.</p>
